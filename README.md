### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I have a Bachelor's and a Master's degrees from the
[Faculty of Engineering](https://www.eng.uminho.pt/pt) of the
[University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/) in Software
Engineering. I have specialized in Data Science, Web
Development and Syntactic Analysis.

Since January 2023, I am a Computer Science PhD student under
the supervision of Professor
[LuÃ­s Torgo](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~ltorgo/) at
[Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca).

My main interests are in the field of Data Science, specifically in
Machine and Deep learning, forecasting, and spatiotemporal data
analysis.
